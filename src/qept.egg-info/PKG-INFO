This library provides a simple implementation of Quantum-enhanced Parallel Tempering (QePT), as introduced in a recent Arxiv paper. The QeMCMC subroutines are abstracted to a seperate repo, [QeMCMC](https://github.com/Stuartferguson00/QeMCMC) See also the related method [Quantum-enhanced Simulated Annealing (QeSA)](https://github.com/Stuartferguson00/QeSA).



## Installation

This project uses [`uv`](https://astral.sh/uv), an extremely fast Python package installer written in Rust, intended as a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `pip-tools`.

1.  **Install `uv`:**
    Follow official installation instructions at [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv). For macOS and Linux run:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh
    ```

2.  **Create the Virtual Environment:**
    From the project's root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This will create a local `.venv` folder and install all required dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

## Quick Start
See main.py for a simple implementation of the code, and initialise_models.py to create instances of spin glass ising models
